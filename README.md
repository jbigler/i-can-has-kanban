# I Can Has Kanban?
*Yes, you can!*

![CI/CD](https://github.com/jbigler/i-can-has-kanban/actions/workflows/on_push.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to the meme Kanban board that I created as a learning project for the latest Rails stack.

The project is deployed on a free fly.io instance at http://has-kanban.fly.dev

After creating an account, you can create workspaces which will be able to be shared with others.
Within a workspace you can create as many boards as you need.
Each board has a collection of lists, and each list has a collection of cards.
The boards and lists can be manipulated via drag-and-drop.
If you invite another User to your workspace, you can both work on the same board together. 
Turbo frames and streams are used to broadcast the changes.
